Version 1.0
	This is basic functional version of the code for protein translation.
	As a result, it requires many precomputed parameters (see README.txt)

Version 2.0
	Major changes:
		1. Added the functionality to read in the state of a cell - position of all bound ribosomes on mRNAs. 
		   This allows the simulation to continue from any particular state of the cell.
		2. Added the ability to simulate the effects of cycloheximide (CHX) and harringtonine (Harr).
		   CHX acts in a reversible manner and takes in 3 parameters for simulation:
		   	(i)   Time at which CHX is introduced into the cell (Tc).
			(ii)  Probability with which a recently elongated ribosome is bound by CHX (x1).
			(iii) The rate at which CHX bound to a ribosome dissociates (x2).
		   Harr acts in a irreversible manner by binding a free ribosome. Upon initiation a Harr bound ribosome
		   stalls immediately at the start codon. Harr simulation takes in 2 parameters:
		   	(i)   Time at which Harr is introduced into the cell (Th).
			(ii)  The rate at which Harr binds to fre ribosomes (y).

	Minor changes:
		1. The simulation code now requires GSL library for random number generation using gsl_rng_mt19937 algorithm.
		2. The code now allows printing of several pre-processed files (see README)
